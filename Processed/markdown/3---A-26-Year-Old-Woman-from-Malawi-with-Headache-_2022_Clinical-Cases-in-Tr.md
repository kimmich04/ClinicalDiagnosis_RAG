# Page 13 A 26-Year-Old Woman from Malawi with Headache, Confusion and Unilateral Ptosis JURI KATCHANOV Clinical Presentation History A 26-year-old Malawian woman is brought to the emergency department of a local central hospital by two relatives. She has been unwell for at least 1 week. She complained of a headache of insidious onset and has been confused for 2 days. One day before presentation the relatives (‘guardians’) noticed an eyelid drooping on the left side. The guardians say her past medical history is unremarkable. The patient lives in an urban high-density area. She works as a businesswoman, selling vegetables. She has three healthy chil-dren, but another four of her children have died as toddlers. Her husband died a year ago of ‘high fever.’ Clinical Findings On examination she looks seriously unwell. Glasgow Coma Scale 14/15, temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), blood pressure 115/75mmHg, heart rate 86bpm, respiratory rate 18 breath cycles per minute. There is no neck stiffness. The chest is clear. Figure 3.1 shows the examination of her eyes. The remainder of her neurological examination is normal. Laboratory Results Her blood results are shown in Table 3.1. A lumbar puncture is done. The opening pressure is markedly raised, at 32cmH2O (12-20cmH2O). The available CSF results are shown in Table 3.2. Questions 1. What is the clinical syndrome and what is the differential diagnosis? 2. How would you manage this patient? Discussion A young Malawian widow presents with headache and con-fusion. She is febrile and has a unilateral third nerve palsy. The CSF examination reveals an inflammatory picture with low glucose. • Fig. 3.1 (A) There is complete ptosis on the left. (B) On primary gaze, the left eye is in a ‘down and out’ position. 7 # Page 2 Answer to Question 1 What Is the Clinical Syndrome and What Is the Differential Diagnosis? The clinical syndrome is that of infectious meningitis. Infec-tious encephalitis should also be considered; however, the cranial nerve involvement makes this diagnosis less likely. Moreover, the main causes of infectious encephalitis are viral or-less commonly-protozoan (e.g. cerebral toxoplasmosis, human African trypanosomiasis), and the CSF findings of very high protein and very low glucose are not consistent with a viral or protozoan CNS infection. Cerebral malaria has to be considered in any patient with fever and impaired consciousness living in a malarious area. However, cerebral malaria would be an uncommonly severe manifestation in a most probably semi-immune adult residing in a holoen-demic area. In addition, cranial nerve palsies are an unusual feature of cerebral malaria. The differential diagnosis comprises bacterial, tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis (Table 3.3). Neither the patient’s clinical presentation nor her CSF results can help differentiate reliably between the three. Furthermore, onset, acuteness and duration of symptoms and signs may have to be interpreted with caution in many cultures, particularly when the history cannot be taken from the patients themselves. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage This Patient? The patient has a suspected CNS infection and is seriously ill with confusion, cranial nerve palsy and a high fever. Imme-diate action should be taken, and treatment should not be delayed whilst further test results are being awaited. Prag-matic treatment should cover bacterial, cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis. Gram-stain and bacterial culture should be done from the CSF. If available, an ultrasensitive PCR for M. tuberculosis (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) should be ordered. The sensi-tivity of Ziehl-Neelsen stain from the CSF is low in many settings. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAG) testing should be done from CSF and serum; additionally, India ink stain and fungal culture should be done for detection of Cryptococ-cus neoformans. An HIV-serology study is crucial because cryptococcal meningitis is associated with immunosuppression. Tubercu-lous meningitis is also more common in HIV-positive than in uninfected persons. The Case Continued. . . The patient was started on ceftriaxone 2g bid, fluconazole 1200mg od (local protocol for cryptococcal meningitis in the absence of amphotericin B and flucytosin) and on treat-ment for presumptive TB-meningitis.

India Ink stain, crypto-coccal and bacterial culture were reported negative, but acid-fast bacilli were detected in the CSF (Fig. 3.2). The diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established. A few days into treatment the patient slipped into a coma. An MRI scan of her brain revealed bilateral basal ganglia infarc-tions. She died in the hospital. SUMMARY BOX Tuberculous Meningitis Tuberculous (TB) meningitis is the most dramatic form of tuber-culosis. After the release of bacilli and granulomatous material into the subarachnoid space, a florid gelatinous exudate forms, which may impair CSF circulation and cause hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies and vasculitis. Vasculitis is the most serious com-plication of tuberculous meningitis and may lead to cerebrovas-cular accidents. A definitive diagnosis of TB-meningitis is established when acid-fast bacilli are seen in the CSF or detected by a reliable molecular method such as PCR, or if Mycobacterium tuberculosis is cultured from the CSF. It is crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion in settings with high TB prevalence (Table 3.4). The WHO now recommends the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra as the initial diagnostic test for suspected tuberculous meningitis. The Xpert is a cartridge-based fully automated PCR test that can easily be used, even in resource-limited settings. TB-meningitis is an emergency. Treatment should be started without delay once the diagnosis is considered. The WHO recommends treatment with the same regimen as any form of tuberculosis starting with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Usually, treatment is for 9 to 12 months. Corticosteroids seem to improve clinical outcomes and are cur-rently recommended; however, their effects may vary in different clinical settings. Further Reading 1. Thwaites G. Tuberculosis.
