# Page 179 A 34-Year-Old Male Immigrant from Peru With Chronic Diarrhoea and Severe Weight Loss THOMAS WEITZEL AND CRISTINA GOENS Clinical Presentation History A 34-year-old man presents to a hospital in Chile with a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea associated with colicky abdominal pain and weight loss of approximately 20 kg. For more than 12 years he has suffered from recur-rent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps; the fre-quency of these episodes appears to have increased in the past 2 years. The patient originates from northern Peru but has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He reports that his Peru-vian wife and children are healthy, but that his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and subsequent death at the age of 45 and 28 years, respectively. Clinical Findings The patient is cachectic with a severe loss of muscle mass and a body weight of 44 kg (BMI 17). Apart from slight pain on abdominal palpation, the physical examination is normal: He is afebrile, liver and spleen are not enlarged, there is no palpable lymphadenopathy and no peripheral oedema. Laboratory results His laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 79.1. Other Investigations Abdominal CT scan and abdominal MRI are without any pathological findings. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy appeared macroscopically normal. Histology of a duodenal biopsy is shown in Fig. 79.1.

Which helminth infections can cause such clinical manifes-tations and which parasitological examination(s) should urgently be performed to clarify the histopathology report? 2. Would you order any additional investigations? Discussion A migrant of Peruvian origin living in Chile presents with chronic diarrhoea and abdominal pain, leading to severe weight loss and cachexia. Laboratory values show signs of malabsorption and inflammation. The physical examination, abdominal imaging and upper GI endoscopy are unremark-able, but the pathologist reports structures compatible with helminth infection in duodenal biopsies. Answer to Question 1 Which Helminth Infections Can Cause Such Clinical Manifestations and Which Parasitological Examination(s) Should Urgently Be Performed to Clarify the Histopathology Report? Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and wasting are usually not associated with intestinal helminth infections. Therefore diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. The two main hel-minth species capable of causing chronic diarrhoea and wast-ing are Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis (see Case 58). In immunocompromised patients, intestinal protozoa such as Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli might cause similar manifestations. Our patient originated from northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for S. stercoralis. Routine ova and parasite stool tests might be ordered; but most importantly, specific tests to detect larvae of S. stercoralis such as an agar plate method or the Baermann technique should be performed. The latter has the advantage of being technically simple and providing results within a few hours. If stool samples are positive, respiratory samples and urine should also be examined for S. strongyloides larvae. Answer to Question 2 Would You Order Any Additional Investigations? Because S. stercoralis is the most probable cause of this severe disease, serology for HTLV-1 should be ordered. HTLV-1 is an important risk factor for S. stercoralis hyperinfection syn-drome, and Peru is endemic for this retrovirus. The family history of the patient also hints at this virus that is commonly transmitted by breastfeeding. The Case Continued… The patient was hospitalized and stabilized under symptom-atic treatment and parenteral nutrition. After the histopa-thology report was received, a fresh stool sample was sent to the parasitology laboratory for Baermann testing, which demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercor-alis (Fig. 79.2A). Numerous larvae were also present in respi-ratory secretions (Fig. 79.2B), but not in urine. Oral treatment with ivermectin (200 μg/kg per day 7 days) was initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co-infection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered from diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within weeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months was negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and was without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first time in more than 10 years. Baermann testing of the family and other household members revealed asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection of his wife and one of the two children. His wife tested HTLV-1 positive, but both children were negative. • Fig. 79.2 (A) Baermann technique showing high load of motile rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis in a stool sample.

It is a poverty-associated neglected disease, endemic in most tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Strongyloidiasis is not unusual in returning travellers, who typically present with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints and/or eosinophilia (see Case 20). In immunocompromised patients, the parasite may multiply massively, resulting in severe and potentially fatal com-plications, commonly called “hyperinfection syndrome”. Corti-costeroids play a major role as a risk factor for strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome. In addition, HTLV-1 infection is an important predisposing condition. HTLV-1 is a neglected retrovirus, which is primarily transmitted by breastfeeding, but also by sexual contact and blood products. It causes a Th1-predominant T-cell proliferation and a marked shift towards type 1 cytokines. This immunological imbalance affects the Th2-mediated control of S. stercoralis, with the risk of accelerated auto-infection leading to increased loads of Stron-gyloides adults and larvae. In HIV/AIDS, T-cell response is shifted towards Th2 cytokines; therefore HIV infection is not usually associated with strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, even though some cases have been described, e.g. in the context of immune reconstitution inflam-matory syndrome (IRIS). HTLV-1-associated S. stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome mostly presents as severe chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, and wasting. Disseminated forms, which are characterized by inva-sion of extraintestinal tissues (apart from the lung passage of larvae), a more rapid progress and a high lethality, are more typically found in patients under corticosteroid therapy. Because patients with hyperinfection lack common hallmarks of strongy-loidiasis, such as eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels, diagnosis is often delayed or missed. The drug of choice for patients with strongyloides hyperin-fection syndrome is ivermectin given over prolonged periods of time (e.g. 7 days for two or more cycles). Patients with signs of dissemination (e.g. larvae in urine) should be treated with iver-mectin and albendazole in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent Gram-negative infections (e.g. sepsis or meningitis) commonly associated with larval dissemination. Management can be challenging in severely ill patients inca-pable of resorbing ivermectin from the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. in paralytic ileus, because no parenteral anthelminthic drugs are licensed for use in humans. However, parenteral ivermectin is commonly administered in veterinary medicine and some case reports describe successful subcutaneous treatment with a vet-erinary formulation of the drug. Because treatment failures might occur, patients require close follow-up. Family members should be screened for both S. stercoralis and HTLV-1 infection. Patients originating from endemic countries should be screened for Strongyloides infection before initiation of any immunosuppres-sive therapy. Further Reading 1. Brooker SJ, Bundy DAP.
